# Hi there! I'm Evo Eclipse! 🌟

✨ I'm a student software engineer who can't imagine life without coding and learning new things! I graduated from the Samsung Academy with a focus on *Android development with Java*, and now I'm studying *iOS development* at Yandex. My skills and tech stack are quite impressive (or at least I hope so 😄), and my studies in *software engineering* help me broaden my horizons every day! 📚💻

- 👀 I’m interested in mobile development (Android, iOS), exploring new technologies, and working on pet projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOS development with Swift and expanding my skills in software engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile app projects, server setups, or anything creative in the tech space.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love exploring the world of game development and design, and I'm always open to learning new creative skills like drawing! 🎨

### My tech stack 🎮🔧

#### Superpower (S-tier):
- *Java (Android)*

#### Pretty confident (A-tier):
- *C++*

#### Decent skills (B-tier):
- *Python, Jupyter, Bash, Docker, HTML + CSS + JS (Frontend)*

#### Need more practice (C-tier):
- *Spring, Rust*

Of course, I'm familiar with *Linux* and use it for everyday tasks! 🐧

### What I'm currently up to:
- I'm learning to build *iOS apps* and exploring everything about mobile development! 📱

Feel free to check out my projects or learn more about my journey! 😊
